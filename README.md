Open the folder
You will see a set of folders, in these folder there are the first dataset (used to fine tune) and the second dataset (created by me). There are more than one because I modified the images
The code is is the file 'handwritten_notebook'.
The .pth files are some tries to find the best weights for the model.
'Report_Menti_Tommaso_VR504908' is the report of the project.
I couldn't upload the .csv file with the pixels of the images because it was too big.
For any question: tommaso.menti@studenti.univr.it
